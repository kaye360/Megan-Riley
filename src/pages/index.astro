					My name is Megan and I'm honored to be your multi-sensory mentor and teacher. As someone with multi sensory gifts, I see, hear, feel, sense, taste and smell things that most people don't.  
				</p>
	
				<p>
					I have a ridiculously high IQ and at one point growing up memorized the phone book, just in case I needed one of the numbers. (And if you couldn't tell I also have 2 forms of ADHD and am Autistic) I have premonitory dreams, astral travel, see patterns, predict cool stuff and have a wild memory for somewhat useful information.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					I'm also a person in recovery and completely get the world of addiction and sensitivity.But this community isn't about me; it's about us.  
				</p>
	
				<p class="text-xl">
					We are a collective of individuals on a journey of personal power, intuition, discernment and heart.
